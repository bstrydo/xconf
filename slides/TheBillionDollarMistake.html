        I call it my billion-dollar mistake!  At that time, I was 
        designing the first comprehensive type system for references 
        in an object-oriented language. My goal was to ensure that 
        all use of references should be absolutely safe, with checking
        performed automatically by the compiler. But I couldnâ€™t 
        resist the temptation to put in a null reference, simply 
        because it was so easy to implement. This has led to 
        innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system crashes, 
        which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in the last forty years.
